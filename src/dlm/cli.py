"""``dlm`` — the command-line entry point for the whole pipeline.

The architectural rule (§2.1 of the project brief) is that the UI is a thin
client: every capability the Streamlit app exposes must already exist as a
CLI command here. Sub-commands are added stage by stage as their underlying
modules land:

- Stage 1 adds ``dlm network build`` / ``dlm network stats``.
- Stage 2 adds ``dlm instance new`` / ``add`` / ``remove`` / ``random`` / ``list`` / ``show`` /
  ``map``.
- Stage 4 adds ``dlm plan``.
- Stage 5 adds ``dlm disrupt validate`` / ``preview`` / ``new``.
- Stage 6 adds ``dlm compare``.
- Stage 7 adds ``dlm batch``.

This file intentionally has no domain logic — every command is a thin
wrapper that parses arguments and calls into ``dlm.network`` / ``dlm.instance``
/ ``dlm.solver`` / ``dlm.disruption`` / ``dlm.simulation``.
